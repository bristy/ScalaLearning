# ScalaLearning
### Why Scala?
I joined AWS MSK in since October 2019. Since then, I've been working on managing thousands of Kafka clusters.
My job requires me to deep dive into Kafka issues and sometimes Kafka codebase to diagnose the problems for our customers.
Kafka codebase is written in scala. I already knew Java so navigating through kafka codebase was not that tough. 
Recently, I contributed a bug fix[1] in Kafka codebase. I want to continue to contribute more so I've decided to learn about scala.
I believe learning kafka will enable me to read kafka codebase faster and contribute back to Kafka community.
